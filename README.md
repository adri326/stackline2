# Stackline v2

This is the successor of [stackline](https://github.com/adri326/stackline), an esoteric language inspired by [Wireworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WireWorld.html) and [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca).

Although it wasn't influenced by it, stackline has a lot in common with [Befunge](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge).
[Befungell](https://github.com/zwade/Befungell)'s concurrency model acts in a very similar way to Stackline's, with the main difference being that Stackline's concurrency stems from a cellular automaton.

Until the core of the language is stabilized and submitted to crates.io, its documentation will be rendered daily on [https://shadamethyst.xyz/stackline/](https://shadamethyst.xyz/stackline/).
